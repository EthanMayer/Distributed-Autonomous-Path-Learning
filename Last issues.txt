Last issues:
- The backwards direction, notably reorienting and when this is called: `
                                # Record it
                                print("Adding interval", str(minA) + ":" 
                                        + str(maxA), "with distance", dist)
                                distancesAtAbsoluteAngles[minA:maxA] = dist` are broken, it's almost fully working and then it should be able to do the course (see videos -- it can complete the course due to a bug in this angle checking...)
- Then try receiving a path and running the car again from the start with that path.
