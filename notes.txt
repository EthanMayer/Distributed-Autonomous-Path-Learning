Todos:
- The bot can get stuck in an enclosed area.
- Edges of walls with half the robot's width needing to be checked when moving forward
- Finding the end of the course (BFS)

Ideas
- [Flow] Points to track can be used instead of flow (velocity) vectors
- [Gyro] Gyroscope can have its angle increased by a magic value as more shaking is detected by the car turning!

Immediate todos:
- Everyone: Put rubber bands on Pi
- Will: test traction on surfaces with a test program
